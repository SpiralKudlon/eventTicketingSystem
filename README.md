## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 11+ installed
- Node.js 14+ and npm installed
- Maven 3.6+ installed
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended for backend)

### Backend Setup

1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Open the backend folder in IntelliJ IDEA
   # IntelliJ will automatically detect the Maven project
   ```

2. Run the application:
   - Locate `EventTicketingApplication.java`
   - Right-click → Run 'EventTicketingApplication'
   - Or use Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`

3. Verify:
   - Backend: http://localhost:8080
   - H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
   - API: http://localhost:8080/api/events

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:3000

## Database Schema

The system uses three main entities with proper JPA relationships:

### Entities
- User - Customer information
- Event - Event details (name, location, date, price in KES)
- Ticket - Purchased tickets with unique codes

### Relationships
- User → Tickets (One-to-Many)
- Event → Tickets (One-to-Many)
- Ticket → User & Event (Many-to-One)

See `documentation/ER_Diagram.png` for the complete ER diagram.

## API Endpoints

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - Get all events
- `GET /api/events/{id}` - Get event by ID
- `GET /api/events/location/{location}` - Filter by location
- `GET /api/events/category/{category}` - Filter by category

### Tickets
- `POST /api/ticket/purchase` - Purchase a ticket
- `GET /api/ticket/{ticketCode}` - Get ticket by code

See `documentation/Postman_Collection.json` for complete API testing.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Dependency Injection (Spring Boot)
Spring Boot's IoC container automatically manages bean lifecycle and dependencies. Demonstrated in services and controllers with constructor injection.

### 2. Virtual DOM (React)
React efficiently updates only changed components rather than re-rendering the entire page, improving performance.

### 3. RESTful API Design
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- Meaningful resource URLs
- Appropriate status codes (200, 201, 400, 404)
- JSON request/response format

### 4. React Hooks
- `useState` - State management
- `useEffect` - Data fetching and side effects
- `useNavigate` - Programmatic navigation
- `useParams` - URL parameter extraction

### 5. JPA Relationships
- One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships
- Cascade operations
- Lazy loading

## Kenyan Context

### Pre-loaded Events
The system comes with 8 authentic Kenyan events:
1. Nairobi Tech Summit - Technology conference at KICC
2. Mombasa Beach Festival - Coastal celebration at Diani Beach
3. Kisumu Jazz Festival - Music event at Lake Victoria
4. Nairobi Marathon - Sports event at Uhuru Park
5. Eldoret Agricultural Expo - Agricultural showcase
6. Nakuru Comedy Night - Entertainment event
7. Thika Food & Wine Festival - Culinary experience
8. Machakos Cultural Festival - Cultural celebration

### Localization
- Prices in KES (Kenyan Shillings)
- Phone numbers in Kenyan format (+254)
- Events from major Kenyan cities
- Date/time in East African timezone

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `documentation/` folder:

- Project_Report.md - Complete project documentation
- Postman_Collection.json - API testing collection
- ER_Diagram.png - Database schema visualization
- README-backend.md - Backend setup and details
- README-frontend.md - Frontend setup and details

## Testing

### Backend Testing
Use the Postman collection to test all API endpoints:
```bash
Import documentation/Postman_Collection.json into Postman
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```
